Visit the official [documentation](https://smarthub-io.github.io/SmartHub-Docs/) for more information.

The Idea behind Smarthub is to make smarthome software on raspberry pis etc. more accessible to the average person, by making the the installation and the Ui as easy to use.
But also having advacned features and settings for more advanced users.

The biggest goal for me is that I can completely use __SmartHub__ at home and make it an open source project where everyone (especially beginners) can try out/ learn new things and contribute it.
